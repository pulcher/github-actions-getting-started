# Getting started with Github Actions

Do you have a repository on Github?  If so, have you configured Github Actions to help automate all the tasks associated with your project? Think your project is too big, or too small for Github actions?  You would be wrong on that account.  It doesn't matter whether the release requires an installer to be built, a push to a web server, a docker container built, or even updating a .NET services running on a Raspberry PI.  Flexibility is one of the strong suits of Github Actions!  Come to my talk and I will go over the main features along with demonstrations of setting up workflows in github proper and self-hosted on a remote device.  



Github actions make it __fun and easy__ to add a CI/CD pipeline to any project.  If you are using github now for any project, you already have access to Github Actions.  There is no project too big or too small for actions.  Actions can do way more than "compile code"








So how is your CI/CD pipeline treating you?  What you don't have a pipeline?  Oh, tour project is too small?

You already have access to this?
Not using any form of CI/CD?  Not even sure what that means?
What can I deploy to?
